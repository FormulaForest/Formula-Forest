# Formula-Forest
Computational models of the physics behind our racecar for the STEM Racing competitions.

## Areas of Improvement

1) Add tether line friction
2) Include the accurate position of the point of application in the definition of every force
3) Fix rotational motion aspect
4) Test and make sure the result is accurate and logical
